We are going to create agents for decision-making in deep and complex sequential environments with huge state spaces,  
like Pluribus which beats top professional poker players in No-Limit Holdem poker with 10^161 states. We can do this  
with combining following three main components


## CFR Algorithms
For making decisions in environments with sequential structures, like games, specifically imperfect information games 

- We are going ti implement different variations of CFR 
  - Vanilla CFR
  - CFR+
  - Chance Sampling CFR
  - Linear CFR
  - MCCFR
  - Our improvements of CFR

## Real time search and Depth Limited Solving in subgames

## State space clustering and abstractions
